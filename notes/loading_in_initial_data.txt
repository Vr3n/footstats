The initial data will consist of:
1. Continents and Countries (This will be covered in the fixtures).
2. Leagues and Its Seasons.

# First time load.

When user starts the project first time,
show `load data` button at the home page if data doesn't exist.

- It will fetch the data on the database in the background.
- Fetching Task will be handled by celery.
- There will be loaders to indicate the progess of the data loading.
- The Continents and Countries will be loaded in from the fixtures.
- A Json file will be saved in the `stats/initial_data` folder so the user \
  doesn't have to refetch from the internet again and again.
